{% newthought 'The Dactyl Manuform' %} is not a name of some dinosaur, it's a keyboard!. A split, ortholinear, opensource keyboard to be exact. I have used one for around a year now, and will review my experience using it. <!--more-->

# The What

Dactyl Manuform's come in a variety of flavors. Mine is a 5x7 one. I opted for blank key caps and the key switches are silent alpacas. The key switches came lubed from the maker. I bought it off r/mechmarket on Reddit. It took a while to ship to where I was, months longer than the estimate which made me and the seller both a little worried that the postal service lost the package. When it did get here one of the bottom plates was slightly bent (probably due to the heat in transport), my Dactyl Manuform is 3d printed so what I did was hold the plate to a candle and bend it the correct way, I don't recommend this, but it did work. The board came pre-flashed, so I just had to plug it in and start typing. You could make your own, but I didn't have the recources, experience or will to figure it out.

If you look closer you can see that the thumb cluster is different from a usual Dactyl Manuform's. Why? I have no idea. I haven't used a normal Dactyl so can't really compare thumb cluster feel. It cost around 300 USD, pretty pricey for a keyboard, but not for a dactyl. Not hotswapable.

# The Why

I was looking to switch my keyboard to avoid RSI and wrist pain. First learned about ortholinear keyboards like the Planck, then learnt about split keyboards such as the Corne. Didn't really need the portability of a Corne and the time I tried to buy a Sofle the seller couldn't ship it to me. Then heard a lot of good things about the Dactly Manuform, people saying it saved their wrists ect. so decided to buy that. Already could type at around 70wpm, without looking at the keyboard, so going for a blank keycapped one was not an issue.

# The review

I really like the keyboard, when I have to use a normal keyboard, I miss using the dactyl. It has allowed me to get to a better posture easier also my wrists and carpal tunnel don't feel strained while using it. There is a learning curve but depending on your priorities it should be easy to get over. I didn't have any typing bad habits when starting out(for example hitting G with your right hand) that might have made it easier for me to adapt. It is a bit pricey, but it was worth it will continue to be worth it if it means I don't get RSI, health is important. However, these are 3D printed and handwired so quality might vary from seller to seller significantly. Furthermore, because I got the 5x7 I don't have to switch layers to use the number keys, if I got a smaller layout board this will also add to the learning curve. 

Now for the downsides. Firstly it's not very portable. You can't carry it around, it's big, it's bulky and 3D printed stuff reacts badly to heat. If you want a quick switch this keyboard is not it, there is a learning curve as stated before. It is expensive and is hard to find, specially if you live in a country far from the US. If you want one made to your specification the queues often stretch for months. Some people are uncomfortable with the thumb cluster, I found the thumb cluster rather pleasant and useful. But my thumb cluster as previously stated is a bit different from the norm.

In short if you think you'd use it and can put the effort to learn how to use it do get it. It is important to check the quality of the makers work because it might differ from place to place. And if you do get one I hope you have fun using it! Meanwhile, hopefully I grow enough confidence to flash the keyboard with an alternate keyboard layout (looking at you colemak-dh).
